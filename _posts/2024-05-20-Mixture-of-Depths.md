“Choice and concentration” is an effective strategies for achieving success in tasks. It is not necessary to consume same amount of effort and time into all problems. If we expend our energy on trivial issues, we may fail to concentrate on what truly matters. Similary, a technique was introduced that allows languge models to allocate less budget to non-essential tokens instead of focusing equally on all tokens.

The tremendous technique developed by Google DeepMind Researchers is called Miture-of-Depths, or MoD for short. In this blog post, we take a look at building blocks of MoD and how they works.

Let's dive in!
